                  >London Elaine Harrell, 21, of Orlando, FL, formerly of
                  Columbia, died following a tragic hit-and-run

              <p class="london-story-text">
                London was described as a beautiful friend that was passionate
                for helping others. Throughout her life she was busy raising
                money and actively dedicating her time on any cause that was
                brought to her attention.

                  <strong>After hitting London, the driver didn't stop.</strong>
                  She wasn't on the road—she was walking in the grassy area when
                  the car came so fast she had no time to move.
                  <strong>He drove across the grass</strong> to strike her, then
                  fled the scene.
                </p>

                <p class="london-story-text">
                  <strong>London was put into a coma</strong> from her injuries.
                  Meanwhile,
                  <strong>the driver had THC in his blood</strong> and was later
                  <strong>found passed out in a parking lot.</strong> He chose
                  to get high and drive, in his words "he felt like he didn't
                  hit her hard so he kept going," leaving London to die.

              <p class="brooke-story-text">
                Brooke Dawkins was a student at the University of Central
                Florida whose life was tragically cut short in a pedestrian
                accident near campus.
              </p>

              <p class="brooke-story-text">
                Brooke was described as having a "personality larger than life
                with an unstoppable spirit" by the foundation. She was a student
                with a full life that was taken too soon.

              <p class="brooke-story-text">
                "Immediately following Brooke's accident, a trust was formed to
                help fund Brooke's recovery, but upon her passing, the
                BrookeStrong Foundation was created in her honor. The Foundation
                supports the mission of saving and improving lives through organ
                donation as Brooke did."
