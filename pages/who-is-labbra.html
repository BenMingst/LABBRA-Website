                Brooke Dawkins was a student at the University of Central
                Florida whose life was tragically cut short in a pedestrian
                accident near campus.
              </p>

              <p class="brooke-story-text">
                Brooke was described as having a "personality larger than life
                with an unstoppable spirit" by the foundation. She was a student
                with a full life that was taken too soon.

              <p class="brooke-story-text">
                "Immediately following Brooke's accident, a trust was formed to
                help fund Brooke's recovery, but upon her passing, the
                BrookeStrong Foundation was created in her honor. The Foundation
                supports the mission of saving and improving lives through organ
                donation as Brooke did."
